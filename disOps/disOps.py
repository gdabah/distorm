#
# disOps is a part of the diStorm project, but can be used for anything.
# The generated output is tightly coupled with diStorm data structures which can be found at instructions.h.
# The code in diStorm that actually walks these structures is found at instructions.c.
#
# Since the DB was built purposely for diStorm, there are some
# Known issues:
#   1. ARPL/MOVSXD information in DB is stored as ARPL.
#      Since ARPL and MOVSXD share the same opcode this DB doesn't support this mix.
#      Therefore, if you use this DB for x64 instructions, you have to take care of this one.
#
#   2. SSE CMP pseudo instructions have the DEFAULT suffix letters of its type in the second mnemonic,
#      the third operand, Imm8 which is responsible for determining the suffix,
#      doesn't appear in the operands list but rather an InstFlag.PSEUDO_OPCODE implies this behavior.
#
#   3. The WAIT instruction is a bit problematic from a static DB point of view, read the comments in init_FPU in x86sets.py.
#
#   4. The OpLen.OL_33, [0x66, 0x0f, 0x78, 0x0], ["EXTRQ"] is very problematic as well.
#      Since there's another 8 group table after the 0x78 byte in this case, but it's already a Prefixed table.
#      Therefore, we will handle it as a normal 0x78 instruction with a mandatory prefix of 0x66.
#      But the REG (=0) field of the ModRM byte will be checked in the decoder by a flag that states so.
#      Otherwise, another normal table after Prefixed table really complicates matters,
#      and doesn't worth the hassle for one exceptional instruction.
#
#   5. The NOP (0x90) instruction is really set in the DB as xchg rAX, rAX. Rather than true NOP, this is because of x64 behavior.
#      Hence, it will be decided in runtime when decoding streams according to the mode.
#
#   6. The PAUSE (0xf3, 0x90) instruction isn't found in the DB, it will be returned directly by diStorm.
#      This is because the 0xf3 in this case is not a mandatory prefix, and we don't want it to be built as part of a prefixed table.
#
#   7. The IO String instructions don't have explicit form and they don't support segments.
#      It's up to diStorm to decide what to do with the operands and which segment is default and overrided.
#
#   8. Since opcodeId is an offset into the mnemonics table, the psuedo compare mnemonics needs a helper table to fix the offset.
#      Psuedo compare instructions work in such a way that only the first instruction is defined in the DB.
#      The rest are found using the third operand (that's why they are psuedo).
#
# To maximize the usage of this DB, one should learn the documentation of diStorm regarding the InstFlag and Operands Types.
